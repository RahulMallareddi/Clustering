# Clustering

## K-Means of World Happiness Report

The project on K-Means Clustering : World Happiness Report is divided into following tasks:

TASK #1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE

TASK #2: IMPORT DATASETS AND LIBRARIES

TASK #3: PERFORM EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

TASK #4: PERFORM DATA VISUALIZATION

TASK #5: PREPARE THE DATA TO FEED THE CLUSTERING MODEL

TASK #6: FIND THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS 

TASK #7: PERFORM CLUSTERING USING KMEANS

TASK #8: VISUALIZE THE CLUSTERS 

## Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species using K-Means

**Origin of this data** : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

**The dataset consists of 5 columns.**

Column | Description
--- | ---
culmen_length_mm | culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm | culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm | flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g | body mass (g)
sex | penguin sex

Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are **at least three** species that are native to the region. Your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!
